Interval NN for Uncertainity Quantification

This repository contains code to train and test Interval Neural Networks. The provided MATLAB scripts allow you to train the pre-trained Neural Networks, and extend it to Interval Neural Networks.\\
Download the required files from the link(https://ituedutr-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ferah23_itu_edu_tr/EjaYq5nS8G9KmOsiQOArjDwBSQ2CBv8deSMZdujpg0EyPA?e=EH07MU) and extract them to a folder on your local system.\\
Before running the MATLAB scripts, ensure you add the path to the folder containing the pre-trained model files.\\
To train the pre-trained network (pre_net), execute: lstm_pretrain.m, Neural_ode_pre_train.m\\
To train the Interval Neural Networks, execute: Interval_nn_lstm, Interval_NeuralODE.m
